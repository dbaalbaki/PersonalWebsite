    Hello, my name is David Baalbaki. 
    <br />
    I am currently in the DevBuild program at QL. 
    <br />
    Growing up i was star struck when it came down to developing websites. 
    <br />
    Learning everyday brought me closer to this dream becoming true. 
    <br />
    I am currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS. 
    <br />
    When i become very good at this, i will start to develop web pages that have alot of content.
    <br /> 
    My goal is to use alot of color and make it appealing to the end user. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    My hometown is Dearborn, Michigan. I was born in Lebanon and migrated to the United States when i was 7 years old. 
    <br />
    Throughtout most of my life i stayed living in Dearborn. I had gone to Michigan State for school but that was only for a couple years. 
    <br >
    Dearborn has a lot of history as they say Ford was built on these grounds. There is also alot of different people who live among themselve which makes it unique. 
    <br /> 
    I enjoy living here and i plan to spend the rest of my life living around my family and friends. 
</p>
